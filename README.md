# VBS Binder
A new VBS binder generator for running your non-crypted builds without being detected by Windows Defender. Generated .vbs file add a new Windows Defender exclusion (without being detected itself), downloads your file(s) on disk and runs it. This permits to use RATs/Stealers without direct encryption of the file and to avoid SmartScreen alerts. DM me to Telegram to buy it: **@shinyenigma**
